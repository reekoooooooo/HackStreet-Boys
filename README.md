## Initial Plan:

### ML(1-2 members): Use ** Open CV ** with Python because we have prior experience with it, 
and because we can pre process images before OCR for increased accuracy. 
#### -OCR:
1. Finding Serial Number using text detection and extraction.
2. Finding Vegetation growth, guy guards, conduit risers using object detection.
3. Gather Test Images

### Data/Logic(1-2 members): Creating a mock GIS Database, comparison logic, and the risk scoring engine.
#### -GIS Mock DataBase:
1. Create a csv file with fake/prior entries
2. Seed a mock GIS Database
#### -Risk Scoring Algorithm

#### -Comparison Logic

### Frontend(1 member): Create a UI to display results and connect with backend.
#### -UI Using StremLit(may be changed):

#### - Connect to backend mock database

### Presentation(everybody): Create a simple, clean, and effective presentation.\
#### -Presentation:
1. make slides.
2. potential Q&A questions to prepare for.
