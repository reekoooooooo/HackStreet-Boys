PolePad AI (Team-Friendly MVP Plan)

Goal: Turn messy pole photos into structured, trustworthy infrastructure data using AI + a crowd validation loop.

What we’re building (in one sentence)

A system where users upload pole photos → AI extracts the pole ID + pole condition attributes → people confirm/dispute → the system builds confidence → then we output a risk/prediction at the end.

1) What the app does (simple flow)
Step-by-step loop (this is the “working intelligence loop”)

User uploads a photo (pole or pad-mounted asset).

AI finds and reads the asset tag (ID).

AI analyzes the full image to detect key infrastructure attributes (vegetation, safety gear, pole type, etc.).

The app shows a structured result (like a mini inspection report).

Other users can confirm / dispute the AI output.

The system computes a confidence score based on agreement.

The system runs a simple prediction/risk score using the collected data.

That’s exactly what the prompt calls “Computer Vision + Network Intelligence.”

2) Two AI jobs we do at the same time

To avoid confusion: we are not doing “one model.” We’re doing two tasks from the same photo.

A) Asset Tag Detection + OCR (Identity)

Purpose: Identify “which asset is this?”

Use YOLOv8 to locate the tag region (box around the tag)

Use OpenCV to clean that crop (reduce glare, rotate/deskew, increase contrast)

Use EasyOCR to extract the ID text

Normalize the ID (strip spaces, fix common errors like O/0, S/5)

Output example:

pole_id = "625296" or asset_id = "PD41459"

B) Infrastructure Attribute Detection (Context)

Purpose: Determine “what’s going on with the pole?”
Run detection on the full image (not the cropped tag).

MVP attributes to detect (keep it realistic):

Pole type: wood vs composite/metal (basic)

Vegetation encroachment: yes/no

Safety equipment presence: guy guard yes/no (or “unknown” if unclear)

Visible attachments: transformer/hardware yes/no (optional)

Structural anomaly flag: “possible damage” yes/no (optional)

Output example:

pole_type = wood

vegetation = true

guy_guard = false

hardware_present = true

3) Structured Output (what we store)

Every upload becomes a structured record:

{
  "asset_id": "625296",
  "ai_read": {
    "pole_type": "wood",
    "vegetation": true,
    "guy_guard": false,
    "hardware_present": true
  },
  "ai_confidence": {
    "tag_conf": 0.78,
    "veg_conf": 0.80,
    "guard_conf": 0.55
  },
  "timestamp": "..."
}

This matches the requirement: “turn images into structured, verifiable infrastructure data.”

4) Mesh / Social Validation Layer (our “original” part)

This is how we satisfy the “crowd-powered / mesh-style” requirement without building a full social network.

In the UI, after AI results show:

Users can:

✅ Confirm tag number (or correct it)

✅ Confirm/dispute vegetation

✅ Confirm/dispute guy guard

🚩 Flag “possible issue” (free-text note)

📷 Upload another image for the same asset

Consensus/Confidence scoring (simple but powerful)

For each asset_id, we store multiple reports and compute agreement:

If 3 people confirm 625296 → tag confidence ↑

If 2 say vegetation is present and 1 says not → show “dispute” and set lower confidence

This satisfies:

“Community confirmation mechanism”

“Confidence scoring based on consensus”

“Network improves reliability over time”

5) AI as augmentation (how we show it)

We explicitly show:

AI prefills data

AI highlights uncertain characters

Example: 62529? where the last digit is low-confidence

AI provides confidence metrics

Humans fix/confirm faster than manual inspections

This matches the guideline: “AI supports the network — does not operate in isolation.”

6) Prediction at the end (simple + pitch-friendly)

Once we have attributes + consensus confidence, we run a lightweight prediction.

MVP prediction options (pick 1)

Option A (easiest): Rule-based “Risk Score”

Missing guy guard → + high risk

Vegetation present → + medium risk

Low consensus confidence → + inspection priority

Outputs:

risk_level = LOW / MED / HIGH

inspection_priority = Soon / Normal

Option B (better): XGBoost model (still free)
Inputs:

vegetation (0/1)

guy_guard (0/1)

pole_type encoded

number_of_reports

consensus_confidence

Output:

failure_risk_probability (0–1)

Even if trained on “synthetic” data, it demonstrates the concept clearly.

7) What we will demo (judge-ready)

We should demo these moments:

Upload a pole photo where the tag is small → YOLO finds it

OCR reads the tag → we show confidence + allow manual edit

Full-image detection shows vegetation and missing guy guard

Another teammate “confirms” the result → confidence increases

The system outputs a final risk score / inspection priority

That proves:
✅ ingestion + analysis
✅ tag extraction
✅ structured output
✅ mesh validation
✅ network confidence improvement
✅ predictive output

8) Team task split (so everyone knows what to do)

Person A: YOLO Tag Detector (tag box + crop)

Person B: OCR Pipeline (OpenCV preprocess + EasyOCR + normalize + confidence)

Person C: Context Detector (vegetation/guy guard/pole type detection on full image)

Person D: Mesh Layer + Storage (store reports, confirmations, consensus scoring)

Person E: Streamlit UI + Demo Script (upload → results → confirm/dispute → score)

(Optional) Person F: Prediction (rule-based first, XGBoost if time)

9) One-liner pitch for your teammates to remember

“PolePad AI turns messy inspection photos into a living asset registry: AI extracts ID + condition, people verify, confidence grows, then we predict risk and prioritize inspections.”
